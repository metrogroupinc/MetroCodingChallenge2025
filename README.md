# Movie Explorer - Junior Engineer Live Coding Session

## Overview
Welcome to the Movie Explorer live coding session! In this session, you'll work on completing a partially implemented movie search application while collaborating with our software team manager. This challenge is designed to assess your JavaScript fundamentals, API interaction, DOM manipulation, and problem-solving skills in a collaborative environment.


## Session Format
- **Duration**: 90 Minutes
- **Collaboration**: This is a pair programming session where you'll code while discussing your approach with the manager
- **Support**: Feel free to ask questions, discuss options, and work through problems together
- **Goal**: Complete as many features as possible while demonstrating your thought process

## Getting Started
1. We'll provide you with the starter code containing HTML and partially implemented JavaScript
2. Take a few minutes to review the code structure and understand what's already implemented
3. We'll use vanilla JavaScript without additional libraries or frameworks
4. The manager will be available to assist, provide guidance, and answer questions throughout

## API Information
The application uses the OMDb API. We'll provide an API key for you to use during the session.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Search Functionality**
   - Complete the `searchMovies()` function to fetch and display movie search results
   - Display movie posters, titles, and years in a responsive grid
   - Handle cases where no results are found

2. **Movie Details View**
   - Implement the ability to view detailed information about a selected movie
   - Create navigation between the search results and details view

### Bonus Features
1. **Favorites System**
   - Allow users to add/remove movies from favorites
   - Store favorites in localStorage
   - Display the current list of favorite movies

2. **UX Improvements**
   - Add loading indicators when waiting for API responses
   - Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing
   - Handle edge cases (missing images, long text, etc.)
   - Improve the visual design with CSS

### Additional Considerations
- Error handling for API requests
- Loading states
- Responsive design
- Edge cases (missing images, long text, etc.)

## What We're Looking For
During this session, we're evaluating:
- **Technical Skills**: How you implement the required functionality
- **Problem-Solving**: How you approach challenges and find solutions
- **Communication**: How you explain your thinking and discuss options
- **Collaboration**: How we work together during the pair programming
- **Code Quality**: Organization, readability, and maintainability of your code

## Tips for Success
- Think out loud - we're interested in your thought process
- Ask questions when you're unsure
- Focus on making core features work before adding enhancements
- Don't worry about getting everything perfect - we're more interested in how you work
- If you face a challenge, let's work through it together

## Example Solution

A working example of the completed application is available for reference at [metrogroup-movie-explorer.surge.sh](https://metrogroup-movie-explorer.surge.sh). This demonstrates the expected functionality, but your implementation approach may differ.

Remember, this session is as much about assessing how we would work together as it is about technical skills. We're looking forward to coding with you!
